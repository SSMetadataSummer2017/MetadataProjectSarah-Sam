        <dc:description>Frank Stella (born 1936) is an American artist best affiliated with the Minimalist art movement, which arose to counteract the popularity of Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s-1970s. Stella's earliest exhibition took place in New York City - where he had moved in 1958 - and featured this piece, one of his earliest. He still lives and works in New York. Frank Stella is a Minimalist painter working in sculpture and painting. His Die Fahn Hoch! literally translates to "Raise High the Flag!" which was a German Nazi salute during World War II. Some critics think this to be a jab at Jasper Johns' American Flag paintings, which baffled the public but pleased critics. The painting consists of a black square painted on challes which almost simultaneously compels and repels viewers. It's a painting with a nearly sculptural and statuesque quality - a mockery of both Abstract Expressionists and other Modernist artists and critics, who thought that artistic mediums should stay pure and true to form.</dc:description>
