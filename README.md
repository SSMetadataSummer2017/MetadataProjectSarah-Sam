# Minimalist Art Collection Schema Project

 
The class is an introductory Metadata class though the University of PIttsburgh MLIS program, preparing students with a basic understanding of collection through item level metadata schema and creation/editing tools.   
  
Teams were directed to choose a collection of items (images, physical objects, artifacts, etc.) that could be part of fictional digital respoitory. Team members were to choose a strategy for standardized description of the objects in the collection best suited to help increase discoverabilty for intended users.  
Objectives of this project are, as a paired team, to design a complete metadata scheme for an original metadata application scenario of each team's invention. The project should bring together aspects of metadata covered during the course as a whole and give students practical experience in metadata design and  documentation, including; Organizational and/or subject domain context, the digital content, and the envisioned users, functional requirements for browsing, searching/limiting, and identifying the content, including faceted navigation, application profile table listing local, collection‚Äêspecific metadata elements, mappings to Dublin Core, designated vocabularies and other schemes, obligation, cardinality, input guidelines, and examples for each element.
